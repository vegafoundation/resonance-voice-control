## Executive Summary

Este trabajo introduce Voice Control como un marco conceptual fundamental dentro del paradigma de Resonance Data y Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC).

Voice Control representa un enfoque novedoso para modelar el significado, la perspicacia y la sabiduría en sistemas artificiales.

## 1. Introduction

Voice Control addresses a fundamental gap in current AI systems: the inability to preserve and accumulate meaning over time. While modern systems excel at information processing, they lack mechanisms for developing genuine insight or wisdom.

This white paper introduces Voice Control as a conceptual framework within the broader Resonance Data and QIRC paradigm.

---

## 2. Core Definition

**Voice Control** is defined as:

> A conceptual framework that models [specific aspect] as a resonant state with temporal coherence, enabling the preservation and accumulation of meaning over time.

### Key Properties:
- **Resonance-based relevance** (not similarity)
- **Temporal coherence** (not static storage)
- **Meaning preservation** (not mere data retention)
